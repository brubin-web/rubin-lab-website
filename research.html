                        We engineer microbial communities for sustainable biodegradation and bioproduction
                        applications. By understanding and manipulating the complex interactions within
                        microbial ecosystems, we develop solutions for breaking down environmental pollutants
                        and producing valuable compounds.

                        Our research focuses on identifying key microbial players in degradation pathways,
                        optimizing community compositions for enhanced activity, and developing scalable
                        approaches for real-world applications in waste treatment and biomanufacturing.

                        Soil microbiomes play a critical role in plant health, nutrient cycling, and
                        carbon sequestration. We develop precision tools to modify soil microbial
                        communities for improved agricultural outcomes while maintaining ecosystem stability.

                        Our approaches combine metagenomics, targeted genetic editing, and ecological
                        modeling to understand and reshape soil microbiomes. This work has implications
                        for sustainable agriculture, climate change mitigation, and food security.

                    <p>
                        Livestock, particularly cattle, are significant contributors to global methane
                        emissions through enteric fermentation. We target rumen microbiomes to decrease
                        methane production while maintaining or improving animal health and productivity.

                        Using CRISPR-based tools and phage technologies, we selectively modify or
                        eliminate methanogenic archaea in the rumen. Our goal is to develop practical,
                        scalable interventions that can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of
                        livestock agriculture.

                        We leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate the
                        development of microbiome editing technologies. Our computational approaches
                        enable rapid identification of targets, prediction of editing outcomes, and

                        By integrating large-scale microbiome datasets with advanced ML models, we
                        can predict community dynamics, design more effective CRISPR guides, and
                        identify novel therapeutic targets across diverse microbial ecosystems.
