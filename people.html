                            As a postdoctoral fellow in Professor Jennifer Doudna's lab, Ben and colleagues created technologies that enable CRISPR-Cas editing of microbiomes. The Rubin lab continues to develop this platform while working with collaborators to apply microbial community editing tools to various microbiomes, such as those residing in human guts, cow rumens, and plant roots. Ben is also a co-founder of the non-profit Science Corps and, when not in the lab, tries to spend as much time in the Pacific Ocean as possible.

Statistically, she explored phylogenetic correlations of functional traits, horizontal gene transfers, and co-evolution with the host at evolutionary timescales. In the Rubin Lab, Jigyasa will optimize bioinformatics tools to investigate CRISPR-associated transposons regulation. She will also examine mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and host interactions using machine learning models to inform predictions of unknown proteins or novel functions important for understanding largely unexplored MGEs.
